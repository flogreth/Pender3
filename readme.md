we always label so many things at Tinkertank by writing on tape with permanent marker. but because not everyone has the same beautiful handwriting (as i do), we need a device that can standardize and automate this work. so i turned an old 3d printer into a pretty unhandy and overcomplicated yet useful calligraphy robot.
The highlight: a small projector throws the text in exactly the right place so that you can determine the exact position before the labeling process.

## hardware

- 3d printed pen plotter head (i modified [this one](https://github.com/AndrewSink/pltr_toolhead) - you'll find the stl files here)

## custom icon font 

as i couldn't find a quick and aesy way to implement svg import i made a simple script to draw my own wingdings-like svg font for icons. most of the icons are tinkertank related makerspace icons. So far i made an icon for every letter and every small and capital letter. So there's plenty more space for new icons.
