## unique penplotter conversion from Ender3 printer

we always label so many things at Tinkertank by writing on tape with edding. but because not everyone has the same beautiful handwriting, we need a device that can standardize this work. 
The highlight: a small projector throws the text in exactly the right place so that you can determine the exact position before the labeling process.
